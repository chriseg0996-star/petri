# Petri — deterministic microbial RTS (clean rebuild)

A brand-new game, fully independent of the Colony Wars code elsewhere in this repo: its own
solution, its own data set, its own runner and tests. Nothing here references or is referenced
by the old game.

## Layout

One codebase, two runtimes: the deterministic sim source lives under the Unity project's
`Assets/Sim` and is compiled BOTH by Unity's Mono (the graphical client) and by the headless
`.NET` projects (which source-glob those same files). This is the only copy of the sim.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `unity/PetriClient/Assets/Sim` | Engine-free deterministic sim: fixed-point math, defs, world, commands, systems. Compiled by Unity (asmdef `Petri.Sim`, no engine refs) and globbed by the headless build. |
| `unity/PetriClient/Assets/Client` | Unity view layer (asmdef `Petri.Client`): data loader, 20 Hz tick driver, sprite renderer, camera, input→commands, HUD. |
| `unity/PetriClient/Assets/StreamingAssets/Data` | The JSON dataset the Unity client loads (copy of `data/`). |
| `src/Petri.Core` | Headless build: source-globs `Assets/Sim` + `DefLoader` (System.Text.Json, headless-only). |
| `src/Petri.Runner` | Headless CLI: `run-match`, `determinism`. |
| `tests/Petri.Tests` | xunit suite (math, determinism, commands, spawn reuse, data validation). |
| `data/` | Master JSON dataset used by the headless runner/tests. Mirror into StreamingAssets after edits. |

## Running the Unity client

1. Open `unity/PetriClient` in Unity **6000.5.2f1** (Unity generates `.meta`/`Library` on first
   open — commit the new `.meta` files with the next commit; never hand-author one).
2. Press **Play**. The main menu builds itself from code (`MainMenu` via
   `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod`) — no scene wiring. **Skirmish** (map + seed) starts a match;
   matches end with a victory banner back to the menu.
3. Controls (classic RTS — every unit obeys direct orders): **L-click/drag** select
   (dbl-click = all of type, **Space** = all military) · **R-click** move/rally/attack
   (multi-unit moves land in a spread grid centered on the click) · **R-drag** formation
   line (a rank block centered on the drawn curve — line length sets the frontage, down to
   two ranks; melee front, ranged rear, leaders spread evenly along the line itself) ·
   **Shift+R-drag** set facing · **[A]** attack-move ·
   **Ctrl+[1-9]/[1-9]** control groups · **[B]** build · **[S]** stop ·
   **arrows** or **middle-drag** pan · **scroll** zoom.

If mouse/keyboard do nothing, set **Edit ▸ Project Settings ▸ Player ▸ Active Input Handling**
to *Input Manager (Old)* or *Both* — the client uses the legacy `UnityEngine.Input` API.
The view is a pure projection of sim state and never writes back; sprites are generated at
runtime, so authored C&C-style art drops in later by swapping them per def id.

## Iron rules (same discipline as any lockstep RTS)

1. **Fixed-point only** (`Fix`, Q16.16) in sim code — no float/double/`System.Random`/LINQ in ticks.
2. **Everything mutates through Commands** (`CommandLog` → `CommandSystem`). Invalid commands
   reject and change nothing. UI/replays/network peers are all just command sources.
3. **Index-order scans only** — never enumerate a Dictionary/HashSet in tick code.
4. **New persistent state joins `Simulation.StateHash()` AND is reset in `SimWorld.Spawn()`.**
5. Distances/rates in JSON are integer centi-units and ticks (20 ticks/second).

## Implemented so far

- Deterministic tick loop with FNV-1a world fingerprint; replay = re-fed command log.
- Data-driven unit/building defs (pure-integer JSON).
- Automated weighted production (players set composition, buildings build on their own);
  fresh units walk to the rally point and await orders.
- Worker economy: gather from nodes, haul to headquarters.
- Movement, hard-body collision with push-resistance-weighted separation, auto-engage combat,
  HQ-death elimination.
- **Terrain walls**: maps carry immovable circular walls (`"walls": [{x, y, r}]`) that shape
  chokepoints and flanking routes — units slide around them, buildings refuse to stand on
  them. Static map data (never sim state, hashed via DefsHash); all three shipped maps have
  symmetric layouts. Every unit and building type wears a distinct runtime-generated 2D
  silhouette; double-click selects all of a type (units and buildings alike).
- **Strategic buildings**: building weapons and drop-offs are pure def data (`attackDamage`
  etc., `isDropoff`). Five constructibles layer the midgame: spike-battery (turret, costs
  minerals), burrow-node (expansion drop-off — pair with a spire for supply), brood-sac
  (buds free mites; each squashed mite still feeds the enemy 1 evo), chitin-rampart (cheap
  900 HP wall plug), plasmid-reliquary (40 evo, +3 army attack, fragile raid target;
  mutagen-pool rebalanced to 15 evo as the durable small buff).
- **Classic per-unit control**: every unit obeys direct Move / AttackMove / Stop /
  SetFacing — no control layer between the player and their units. Multi-unit right-clicks
  spread into a compact grid centered on the click; right-drag lays the selection along a
  drawn line. The swarm-era command ids (4, 5, 11-15, 23) are retired and reserved (they
  Reject), never to be reused.
- **Leader aura**: the swarm-leader unit survives as a force multiplier, not a control
  handle — friendly units within `leaderAuraRadiusCenti` (6u) of a live same-owner leader
  deal `leaderAuraBonus` (+25%) damage. Derived per-tick scratch (LeaderAuraSystem), never
  hashed; selected leaders draw their aura ring.
- **Combat**: attack-move (advance, divert to engage; plain moves never chase),
  DIRECTIONAL damage (front ×1 / side ×1.25 / rear ×1.5 vs the victim's simulated facing —
  units turn at data-driven turn speeds), visual projectiles for ranged units, death pops,
  health bars.
- **Tech paths**: 4 constructible hub add-ons (Lysis / Flagella / Toxin / Capsule), each
  producing a strong+cheap specialist unit and gating 2 purchasable upgrades. Upgrades are
  per-player hashed state (`PlayerState.UpgradeLevels`) that fold a Num/Den into one integer
  floor at the relevant hot path (damage, armor, move, attack-speed, range).
- **Unity client**: main menu (Skirmish/Settings live; Campaign/Multiplayer/Replay stubs),
  20 Hz fixed-tick driver with client-side game speed, pooled runtime sprites (diamonds =
  ranged, facing arrows), full command UI. The view is a pure projection of sim state.

Next up (per design doc): LOGISTICS/SUPPLY LINES (the untouched defining pillar), the
evolution landmark tier tree, spatial partitioning for the 8k-unit target, authored
animated sprites, then the multiplayer/replay layers the architecture already anticipates.

## Verify (from `newgame/`)

```
dotnet build Petri.slnx
dotnet test Petri.slnx
dotnet run --project src/Petri.Runner -- determinism --seed 42 --ticks 6000
dotnet run --project src/Petri.Runner -- run-match --seed 7 --ticks 12000
```

All four must pass before and after any change; `determinism` must print PASS for both the
fresh rerun and the replay.
